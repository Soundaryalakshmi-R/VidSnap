# VidSnap - AI-Powered Video Summarization
 
VidSnap is an AI-powered video summarization tool that extracts the most important moments from a video using deep learning and diverse subset selection techniques. It enables users to upload a video and receive a concise summary, preserving the key highlights efficiently.  

## Features  
- **AI-Based Summarization**: Uses an LSTM model to predict shot importance.  
- **Keyframe Extraction**: Selects the most informative frames using Determinantal Point Processes (DPP).  
- **Video Snippet Generation**: Creates a summarized video with selected key moments.  
- **Streamlit Interface**: Simple UI for users to upload videos and receive summaries.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**, **TensorFlow** – Deep learning model for video summarization.  
- **OpenCV** – Video processing and frame extraction.  
- **scikit-learn** – Data preprocessing and similarity calculations.  
- **NumPy** – Handling feature matrices.  
- **Streamlit** – Interactive UI for video input and summary output.
